# lp2-Roteador
Programing Language projet to simulate a router communication in a 3x3 matrix

For example:

If we want to move a package from 192.168.0.1 ip adress to 192.168.0.8 ip adress

it will be like this:

[192.168.0.1] -> [192.168.0.2] -> [192.168.0.3]
                                      |                  
                                      v                                                       
[192.168.0.4]    [192.168.0.5]    [192.168.0.6]
                                      |
                                      v
[192.168.0.7]    [192.168.0.8] <- [192.168.0.9]
